# Omnes Medium: A Rounded and Crisp Font for Editorial Work
 
Omnes Medium is one of the 72 fonts in the Omnes family, designed by Joshua Darden and published by Darden Studio. Omnes is a sans serif typeface that features selective rounding, non-geometric forms, and a wide range of weights and widths. Omnes Medium is a balanced and versatile font that can be used for both text and display purposes.
 
Omnes was originally conceived as the brand typeface for a national retail chain, but it has since been adopted by many other clients for various projects. Omnes takes inspiration from 19th-century rounded Grotesques, but adds a contemporary touch with its crisp and curvaceous shapes. Omnes also includes many robust features, such as index characters, tabular figures, fractions, arrows, extended language support, and stylistic sets.
