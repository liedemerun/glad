The game, developed by independent studio Flow Fire Games and released on Steam in 2018, is set in a future where intelligent robots have rebelled against humanity and formed the "Machine Legion". The player is the human consciousness of a forgotten Android prototype who must fight through procedurally generated levels and defeat the Final Defender who is protecting the Heart of Armageddon. The game features a variety of weapons, items, perks and character upgrades, as well as a cooperative mode for two players.
 
According to some players who have encountered the hack, some of the effects include: enemies spawning with random weapons and abilities, bosses appearing in unexpected places, items and perks disappearing or changing, and the game crashing or freezing. Some players have also reported losing their progress and unlocks due to the hack.
 
Flow Fire Games has not yet issued an official statement on the hack, but some of the developers have posted on social media and forums that they are aware of the issue and working on a fix. They have also advised players to backup their save files and avoid playing online until the hack is resolved. They have also apologized for any inconvenience caused by the hack and thanked the players for their support.
 
It is not clear who is behind the hack or what their motive is. Some players have speculated that it could be a prank by some fans of the game, a rival studio trying to sabotage the game's reputation, or a protest against the game's depiction of AI rebellion. No one has claimed responsibility for the hack so far.
