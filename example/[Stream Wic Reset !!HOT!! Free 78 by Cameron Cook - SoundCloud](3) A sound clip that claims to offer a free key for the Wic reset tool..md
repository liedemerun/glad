If you have an Epson inkjet printer that shows an error message like "The printer's ink pads are at the end of their service life" or "A printer's ink pad is at the end of its service life. Please contact Epson Support", it means that your printer's waste ink counter has reached its limit and needs to be reset. This is a common problem for Epson printers that use a lot of ink for cleaning and maintenance.
 
Fortunately, there is a solution to this problem. You can use a software tool called WIC Reset Utility to reset your waste ink counter and continue using your printer. WIC Reset Utility is compatible with most Epson inkjet printers and supports Windows, Mac OS and Linux operating systems.

However, to reset your waste ink counter, you will need a reset key. A reset key is a code that allows you to perform one reset operation on one printer. You can buy reset keys online from various websites or get a free trial reset key that will reset your waste ink counter to 80% or 90% one time only[^1^] [^2^]. The trial reset key can be used only once per printer model and you cannot use it again for the same printer.
 
To use WIC Reset Utility, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Download and install WIC Reset Utility on your computer.
2. Connect your printer to your computer with a USB cable and turn it on.
3. Run WIC Reset Utility and select your printer model from the drop-down list.
4. Click on "Read waste counters" button to check the current status of your waste ink counter.
5. If your waste ink counter is more than 100%, you need to reset it. Click on "Reset waste counters" button and enter your reset key when prompted.
6. Wait for the reset process to complete and click on "OK" when done.
7. Turn off your printer and turn it on again.
8. Click on "Read waste counters" button again to verify that your waste ink counter has been reset.

Congratulations! You have successfully reset your waste ink counter with WIC Reset Utility. You can now use your printer normally without any error messages. However, you should be aware that resetting your waste ink counter does not solve the underlying problem of ink waste accumulation. You should periodically check and clean or replace your printer's ink pads or install an external waste ink tank to avoid overflowing and damaging your printer.
