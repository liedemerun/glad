However, we recommend that you support the developers by buying the game from Steam if you enjoy it.

Star Command Galaxies is a game that has been in early access since 2015, and has been receiving regular updates from the developers. The game is inspired by classic sci-fi shows like Star Trek and Firefly, and lets you experience the thrill of being a starship captain.
 
The game has a lot of features that make it stand out from other space games. You can customize your ship with different rooms, weapons, and equipment, and assign your crew members to different roles. You can also interact with your crew and learn about their personalities, perks, quirks, and relationships. You can even name your ship and crew after your favorite characters from sci-fi shows or movies.
 
The game also has a dynamic and procedurally generated universe that changes every time you play. You can encounter different races, factions, planets, and events that will challenge you and shape your story. You can choose to be a peaceful explorer, a ruthless pirate, a loyal ally, or a cunning diplomat. You can also engage in combat with other ships, board them, loot them, or even take them over.
 
The game is still in development and has some bugs and issues that need to be fixed. However, the developers are very responsive and listen to the feedback from the community. They also have a roadmap for future updates that will add more content and features to the game. Some of the planned features are:

- A mod tool called SCIENCE (Star Command Isometric Enhanced New Creation Editor) that will let you create your own ships, missions, races, and more.
- A multiplayer mode that will let you play with or against other players online.
- A sandbox mode that will let you explore the galaxy without any restrictions or objectives.
- A campaign mode that will give you a more structured and story-driven experience.

Star Command Galaxies is a game that has a lot of potential and promises to be a fun and immersive starship simulator. If you are a fan of sci-fi shows or movies, or if you just love space games, you should give it a try. You can find it on Steam for $19.99 USD.
