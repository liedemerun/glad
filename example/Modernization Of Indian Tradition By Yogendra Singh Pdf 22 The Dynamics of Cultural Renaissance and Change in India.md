- The book is based on data and sources that are mostly dated and outdated, as it was written in the early 1970s. The book does not take into account the changes and developments that have occurred in India since then, such as the rise of new social movements, the emergence of new forms of identity politics, the impact of globalization and neoliberalism, and the challenges of environmental degradation and social inequality.
- The book adopts a linear and evolutionary perspective on modernization, which assumes that modernization is a universal and inevitable process that leads to social progress and development. The book does not adequately address the diversity and plurality of modernity and tradition in India, nor does it acknowledge the possibility of alternative or multiple modernities. The book also does not critically examine the normative and ideological implications of modernization, such as its relation to colonialism, nationalism, secularism, and democracy.
- The book relies heavily on quantitative and statistical methods of analysis, which tend to ignore or overlook the qualitative and contextual aspects of social reality. The book does not pay enough attention to the lived experiences, meanings, values, and agency of the actors involved in the processes of social change. The book also does not explore the role of culture, power, conflict, and resistance in shaping the outcomes and consequences of modernization.

In conclusion, Modernization of Indian Tradition by Yogendra Singh is a classic and influential work on the sociology of modernization in India. It provides a comprehensive and systematic framework for understanding the processes and problems of social change in contemporary India. However, the book also has some limitations and shortcomings that need to be addressed and updated in light of the changing realities and challenges of Indian society.
