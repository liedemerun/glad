# How to Protect Your PHP Scripts with ionCube PHP Encoder
 
If you are a PHP developer or a website owner who uses PHP scripts, you may want to protect your source code from unauthorized access, modification, or theft. One of the best ways to do that is by using the ionCube PHP Encoder, a powerful tool that converts your PHP code into bytecode, obfuscates it, and encrypts it for added security.

In this article, we will explain what the ionCube PHP Encoder is, how it works, and how you can use it to protect your PHP scripts.
  
## What is ionCube PHP Encoder?
 
ionCube PHP Encoder is a software product that allows you to encode your PHP source code into a format that is difficult to reverse engineer and tamper with. It also provides optional features such as licensing, expiration, domain locking, IP locking, and MAC locking, which let you control where and for how long your encoded scripts can be used.
 
ionCube PHP Encoder supports PHP versions up to 8.1 and works on Windows, Linux, FreeBSD, and macOS platforms. It also has a unique Dynamic Keys feature that uses algorithmic keys that are not stored anywhere, making your encoded scripts even more secure.
 
ionCube PHP Encoder has three editions: Basic, Pro, and Cerberus. The Basic edition provides basic protection and encryption for your scripts. The Pro and Cerberus editions offer advanced protection and licensing capabilities that are ideal for product developers, website designers, and enterprise customers.
  
## How does ionCube PHP Encoder work?
 
ionCube PHP Encoder works by converting your PHP source code into bytecode, which is a low-level representation of your code that can be executed by the PHP engine. Bytecode is harder to read and modify than plain text source code.

ionCube PHP Encoder also applies various obfuscation and encryption techniques to your bytecode, making it even more difficult to understand and manipulate. For example, it can replace variable names with random characters, scramble the order of code blocks, encrypt strings and constants, and use Dynamic Keys to generate encryption keys on the fly.
 
To run your encoded scripts on a web server, you need to install the ionCube Loader, which is a free extension that enables PHP to execute ionCube-encoded files. The ionCube Loader also verifies the integrity of your encoded scripts and checks for any licensing restrictions before executing them.
  
## How to use ionCube PHP Encoder?
 
To use ionCube PHP Encoder, you need to purchase a license from their website[^1^]. You can choose between a one-time purchase or a subscription plan. You can also download a free trial version that lets you test the product for 14 days.
 
Once you have purchased a license, you can download the ionCube PHP Encoder software for your platform. You can either use the command line interface or the graphical user interface (GUI) to encode your scripts. The GUI is available for Windows and macOS users only.
 
To encode your scripts using the GUI, you need to follow these steps:
 
1. Launch the ionCube PHP Encoder application.
2. Select the source files or folders that you want to encode.
3. Select the target folder where you want to save the encoded files.
4. Select the encoding options that suit your needs. You can choose between different levels of protection, encryption, obfuscation, compression, compatibility, and licensing.
5. Click on the Encode button to start the encoding process.
6. Copy the encoded files and the ionCube Loader file to your web server.

To encode your scripts using the command line interface (CLI), you need to follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal window on your system.
2. Navigate to the folder where you have installed the ionCube PHP Encoder software.
3. Run the encoder command with the appropriate options and arguments. For example:
`./encoder -o /path/to/target/folder /path/to/source/file.php`
4. Copy the encoded files and the ionCube Loader file to your web server.
